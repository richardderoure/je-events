                <p class="p-home">Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                    Unqualified, the word footballnormally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
                    word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some
                    countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
                    rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football.
                    These various forms of football are known as football codes.</p>

            <article id="history">
                <p class = "p-history">The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠), as stated by FIFA, is the earliest form of football for which
                    there is scientific evidence and appears in a military manual dated to the second and third
                    centuries BC.[14] It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and
                    third centuries BC.[15] The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the
                    Asuka period.[16] This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from
                    about 600 AD. In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not
                    to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie).</p>

            <article id="popularity">
                <p class ="p-popularity">Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.[10] Globally,
                    association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations,[134] and has the
                    highest television audience in sport,[135] making it the most popular in the world,[136] American
                    football, with 1.1 million high school football players and nearly 70,000 college football players,
                    is the most popular sport in the United States,[137][138] with the annual Super Bowl game accounting
                    for nine of the top ten of the most watched broadcasts in U.S. television history.[139] Australian
                    rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.[140][141] Similarly,
                    Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance,[142] and the
                    All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation’s sporting year.[143 </p>
